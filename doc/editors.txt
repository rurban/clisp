                       Good text editors for Lisp
                       ==========================

This is a small survey of editors available with Lisp support.

1. vi
2. axe
3. Emacs


1. vi
   --

Platforms: Unix, DOS, and probably others.
(I recommend especially elvis-1.4 and vim.)

Characteristics:
- Text mode editor, no mouse support (at least not until elvis-2.0).

Features:
- Fast, small.
- Automatic backup.
- Extremely handy search / replace / repeat functions ("/", "s", ".").
- Deals well with big files (provided enough room in /tmp).

Drawbacks:
- User needs to constantly switch between "command mode" and "insert mode".
- Typos in "command mode" are not undoable.

Lisp support:
- Parenthesis matching function ("%").

Recommended in the following situations:
- All kinds of minor editing operations.
- Non-Unix platform.


2. axe
   ---

Platforms: Unix X11.

Characteristics:
- X11 GUI editor with pull-down menus.

Features:
- Fast, small.
- Multiple windows.
- Easy to use.
- Optimal Cut & Paste functionality.
- Two kinds of search / replace functions.
- Opening a new window from the shell command line ("faxe") is very fast.

Drawbacks:
- Nonstandard menubar layout.
- Slow cursor positioning in files larger than 1 MB.
- Not 100% stable: dumps core with a small probability in certain situations
  (faxe calling, or after search & replace), so it's best to save your files
  regularly.

Lisp support:
- Parenthesis matching (blinks once).

Recommended in the following situations:
- All kinds of major editing operations.

* How to customize axe in general?

  The default font is bold. To choose another font globally, add the
  following to your .Xdefaults:

      Axe*ed*Font:         6x13

  To choose this font only for text pieces, but not for dialog boxes
  (this is prettier), instead add the following to your .Xdefaults:

      Axe*ed.?.Font:       6x13
      Axe*ed*Text*Font:    6x13

  The font must be one existing in your X11 font directory
  (/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts or something like that).


3. emacs, xemacs
   -------------

Platforms: Unix, OS/2, Win32.

Characteristics:
- X11 GUI editor with pull-down menus.

Features:
- Can also be used in text mode.
- Lots of customization packages exist.
- Good integration with Lisp process.
- Automatic backup.
- Extremely powerful.
- Highly customizable for those willing to dig into Emacs Lisp.
- No problems whatsoever with big or huge files.

Drawbacks:
- Needs proper configuration. By default, it doesn't do cut & paste the way
  it is normally done in X11, and sometimes the backspace key is configured
  to trigger a help screen.
- Heavyweight. On a 8 MB machine with X11, Emacs causes much swapping.
  Moreover, process size increases with time.
- The editor is often unresponsive, because of
  - normal Unix swapping,
  - Emacs' conservative GC (incremental and generational GCs don't cause
    noticeable interruptions),
  - automatic backup.
  Often, you click on the menubar and have to wait 10 seconds for the menu.
- Inconsistent user interface:
  - Few functions are available through menus, some through keybindings,
    others only through M-x.
  - Using the scrollbar repositions the cursor.
  - Need to press C-g twice to abort incremental search.
  - many more details like this...
  
Lisp support:
- Parenthesis matching (blinks once).
- Helps indentation of Lisp code.
- Display Lisp keywords, comments, strings in different colours
  (font-lock-mode).
- Keybindings for evaluating forms, macroexpanding forms.

Recommended in the following situations:
- Professional programmer with fast machine needs good integration with
  Lisp running as a separate process.

Discussion:

* What is Emacs good for?

  1. Fill your machine's memory. Remember, EMACS means "Eight Megabytes
     Always Continuously Swapping". And on my 8 MB machine, this is true!

  2. It gives a better interaction with CLISP. When you use CLISP on a
     console, terminal or xterm, your interactions with CLISP are
     limited to:
       - typing text,
       - scrolling in the history,
       - see parentheses matching,
       - cut & paste from/to the xterm.
     In Emacs, you have the entire interaction in a buffer. You have
     a keystroke for evaluating a form, macroexpanding a form etc.

* Which Emacs to use?

  To date, we have the choice between GNU Emacs 18.58 (text mode only),
  GNU Emacs 19.34 (GUI support for X11 and Win32), XEmacs 19.15 (GUI
  support for X11, better than GNU Emacs), XEmacs 20.0 (GUI for X11,
  with support for Hebrew(?) and Asian languages).

  - On Unix without X11, I recommend GNU Emacs v19.
    Available from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/.
  - On Unix with X11, I recommend XEmacs v19.
  - On OS/2, I recommend GNU Emacs patched for emx+gcc by Eberhard Mattes.
  - On Win32, I recommend GNU Emacs 19.34.6.
    Available from http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html.

* How to customize Emacs in general?

  1. Create a file called .emacs in your home directory. (This file
     is called \!EMACS on DOS, and _emacs on Win32. [What about OS/2 ??])
     The file called etc/sample.emacs in the XEmacs distribution might
     be a good starting point.

  2. Get rid of tabs. When you cut & paste some lisp text to clisp, tabs in
     it will make the readline library think that use want completion of
     a symbol, thus causing delays, beeps and general annoyance. Therefore
     don't use tabs at all, except in Makefiles where they are syntactically
     required.

     Add the following to your .emacs:

         ;; Tabs are anachronistic.
         (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

     and add the following to all the Makefiles which you intend to edit
     with Emacs:

         # This is for Emacs.
         # Local Variables:
         # indent-tabs-mode: t
         # End:

  3. Set the path for "info" documentation. If "M-x info" gives an error,
     it is most likely that you have to set a the list of directories
     where Emacs searches its documentation, roughly like this:

         ;; GNU Info pages.
         (setq Info-default-directory-list
               '("/usr/local/info/" "/usr/info/")) 

  4. Choose the default font. On my screen, "6x13" looks better than
     the default "9x15" font, so I put into my .emacs:

         ;; Default font for GNU Emacs 19.
         (if (not (string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version))
           (set-default-font "6x13")
         )

     For XEmacs, you set the default font through an X resource in your
     .Xdefaults file. Get some inspiration from the file called
     etc/sample.Xdefaults in the XEmacs distribution and the files
     /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/*/fonts.alias of your X11 distribution.

  5. Make the X11 selections work the normal way (i.e. as in xedit and
     axe) in XEmacs. Copy the file emacs/souris.el from the CLISP distribution
     to your home directory and insert into your .emacs:

         ;; X11 mouse and selection handling.
         (if (string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version)
           (load-file (concat (getenv "HOME") "/souris.el"))
         )

     Unfortunately, I have no fix for the broken X11 selections in
     GNU Emacs.

* How to customize Emacs for use of CLISP?

  1. When you load a Lisp file (extension ".lsp") into Emacs, it
     automatically switches to lisp-mode, magically by a variable
     called auto-mode-alist.
     One feature of the lisp-mode is that the tab key indents the current
     line, which makes typing Lisp programs easier because you don't have
     to type the whitespace. Unfortunately, this also educates you to lazily
     put all closing parentheses at the end of the line, instead of closing
     them - with thought - one by one.
     The lisp-mode is not well suited for Common Lisp. In particular, IF
     forms get badly indented. To fix this, add the following to your
     .emacs:

         ;; Common Lisp indentation.
         (load-library "cl-indent")
         (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
             (setq lisp-indent-function 'common-lisp-indent-function)
         ) )
         ;; Additional definitions by Pierpaolo Bernardi.
         (defun cl-indent (sym indent)
           (put sym 'common-lisp-indent-function
             (if (symbolp indent)
               (get indent 'common-lisp-indent-function)
               indent
         ) ) )
         (cl-indent 'if '1)
         (cl-indent 'defclass '((&whole 4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1))
                                &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)))
         (cl-indent 'defgeneric 'defun)
         (cl-indent 'defmethod '(4 4 (&whole 4 &rest 1) &body))
         (cl-indent 'generic-flet 'flet)
         (cl-indent 'generic-labels 'labels)
         (cl-indent 'symbol-macrolet 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'with-accessors 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'with-added-methods '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'with-slots 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'handler-bind '((&whole 4 &rest 1) 2 &body))
         (cl-indent 'handler-case '((1 4) (&whole 2 ((0 1) (1 3) (2 &body)))))
         (cl-indent 'define-condition '((1 6)
                                        (2 6 ((&whole 1)))
                                        (3 4 ((&whole 1)))
                                        (4 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'restart-bind '(((&whole 2 (0 1) (&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'restart-case '((1 4) (&whole 2 ((0 1) (&whole 1)))))
         (cl-indent 'with-condition-restarts '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'with-simple-restart '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))

  2. If you still have problems with parentheses and indentation,
     try out the mode-motion package. When you move the mouse cursor on
     an opening parenthesis, it highlights the entire Lisp expression.
     Very nice for checking badly indented Lisp code.
     Insert into your .emacs:

         ;; Visualizing Lisp forms.
         (let ((hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (setq mode-motion-hook 'mode-motion-highlight-sexp))))
           (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook hook t)
           (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook hook t)
           (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook hook t)
           (add-hook 'inferior-lisp-mode-hook hook t)
           (add-hook 'talk-mode-hook hook t)
         )

  3. You might try out syntactic colouring of your Lisp programs.
     Just after loading the first Lisp file into Emacs, type
     M-x font-lock-mode.
     Well, some people like it, some don't.

  4. Now, the easiest way to start clisp within Emacs, is M-x shell,
     and at the shell prompt type

         $ clisp

     In this mode, you cycle through the history using M-p (not C-p
     as with the readline library). Also, to retry a command, just
     place the cursor at the beginning of the command and type
     Return (in XEmacs) or C-c Return (in GNU Emacs).

  5. There is a better Emacs mode, called inferior-lisp-mode.
     CLISP is by no means "inferior" to Emacs Lisp (rather the contrary),
     but CLISP in then turning as a kind of "server", with Emacs as "client".
     For this, add to your .emacs:

         ;; XEmacs doesn't autoload inf-lisp.el, load it now.
         (load-library "inf-lisp")
         ;; Define the program to be called by M-x run-lisp.
         (setq inferior-lisp-program "clisp -I -q")
         ;; Add new keybindings: C-x C-e evaluates the *next* form,
         ;; C-x C-m macroexpands the next form.
         (defun lisp-eval-sexp (&optional and-go)
           "Send the next sexp to the inferior Lisp process.
            Prefix argument means switch to the Lisp buffer afterwards."
           (interactive "P")
           (lisp-eval-region (point)
                             (save-excursion (forward-sexp) (point))
                             and-go
         ) )
         (defun lisp-macroexpand-region (start end &optional and-go)
           "Macroexpand the current region in the inferior Lisp process.
            Prefix argument means switch to the Lisp buffer afterwards."
           (interactive "r\nP")
           (comint-send-string
            (inferior-lisp-proc)
            (format "(macroexpand-1 (quote %s))\n" (buffer-substring start end))
           )
           (if and-go (switch-to-lisp t))
         )
         (defun lisp-macroexpand-sexp (&optional and-go)
           "Macroexpand the next sexp in the inferior Lisp process.
            Prefix argument means switch to the Lisp buffer afterwards."
           (interactive "P")
           (lisp-macroexpand-region (point)
                                    (save-excursion (forward-sexp) (point))
                                    and-go
         ) )
         ;; Define the great keybindings.
         (inferior-lisp-install-letter-bindings)
         (define-key lisp-mode-map          "\C-x\C-e" 'lisp-eval-sexp)
         (define-key inferior-lisp-mode-map "\C-x\C-e" 'lisp-eval-sexp)
         (define-key lisp-mode-map          "\C-x\C-m" 'lisp-macroexpand-sexp)
         (define-key inferior-lisp-mode-map "\C-x\C-m" 'lisp-macroexpand-sexp)

     The "-I" is important. The "-q" is only needed if the banner annoys you.
     Then start CLISP by the command M-x run-lisp.
     In this mode, M-p cycles through the history, as above, but C-c Return
     doesn't work. The keybinding C-x C-e, which may also be issued from
     another lisp-mode buffer, evaluates the form before(!) the cursor.

     If you want to start clisp in different configurations, you can make
     different commands for it, like this:

         (defun clisp ()
           (interactive)
           (setq inferior-lisp-program "clisp -I -q")
           (run-lisp inferior-lisp-program))
         (defun clx ()
           (interactive)
           (setq inferior-lisp-program "clx -I -q")
           (run-lisp inferior-lisp-program))
         (defun garnet ()
           (interactive)
           (setq inferior-lisp-program "garnet -I -q")
           (run-lisp inferior-lisp-program))

  6. There is an even better Emacs mode, called ilisp-mode.
     [Merge here stuff from Marcus, Matthias, Peter.??]
     XEmacs 19.14 comes with ILISP version 5.7. A newer version with much
     better support for CLISP is at http://ilisp.cons.org/ .
