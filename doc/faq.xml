 <answer><para>We levy a fine of 10 zorkmids for
   <link linkend="faq-help">asking a question</link> that is answered

<qandaentry id="faq-ansi"><question id="faq-ansi-q"><simpara>What about
   &ansi-cl; compliance?</simpara></question>
<answer><para>&clisp; <ulink url="clhs/glo"><emphasis>purports to

  deviations in <screen>&sh-prompt; &clisp-cmd; &opt-ansi;</screen>
  from the &ansi-cl; are bugs and are not (yet) fixed only due
  to lack of resources.</para>

 <para>On the other hand, some decisions made by the ANSI X3J13 committee
  were not as justified from the <emphasis>technical</emphasis> point of
  view as were most of them, and some of those questionable decisions
  were made &after-e; the alternative behavior has already been implemented
  in &clisp;.  The &clisp; developers took pains to modify &clisp; to
  unconditionally comply with the &ansi-cl; specification in all cases
  <link linkend="ansi">except for a handful of situations where they
  believed that the committee had made a mistake</link>, in which cases
  the committee behavior is <emphasis>still</emphasis> optionally

<para>Passing &with-debug; to the top-level &configure; script does not
 just replace <option>-O</option> with <option>-g</option>
 in the &gcc; invocation, it also disables some optimizations
 (registers, assembly, generational &gc;or) and enables
 some <function role="unix">printf</function> calls (mostly before error
 messages caused by system calls).
 This means that some bugs might be exhibited by the normal build but
 &not-e; by the &with-debug; one (and vice versa).
 If that is the case, please &configure; normally but edit the
 <filename>Makefile</filename> and replace the &gcc; optimization

 <title>The impact of generational &gc;or</title>
<para>If your &clisp; was built with generational &gc;or, you will see
 plenty of spurious segfaults (that's how the generational &gc;or
 works).  At the end of <filename role="clisp-cvs">src/.gdbinit</filename>
 you will find the following suggested &gdb; commands:
<programlisting language="gdb">handle SIGSEGV noprint nostop
break sigsegv_handler_failed</programlisting>
which will stop execution on a <emphasis>dangerous</emphasis> segfault.
You can find out whether this is needed by examining the output of the

<qandaentry id="faq-menorah-why"><question id="faq-menorah-why-q"><simpara>Why
   is &clisp; using menorah as the logo?</simpara></question>
<answer><label>Whimsical</label>
 <para>If you must have some answer and you do not care whether it is
  correct or not, you may simply think that &cl; brings
  the <emphasis>Light</emphasis> to a programmer, and &clisp; is a
  vehicle that carries the <emphasis>Light</emphasis>.</para>
 <para>Accordingly, &clisp; enables you to <emphasis>see</emphasis> the
  truth, thus you can pronounce it as <emphasis>see-lisp</emphasis>.
  Alternatively, if you are a <emphasis>seasoned</emphasis> expert,
  you might pronounce it as <emphasis>sea-lisp</emphasis>.</para></answer>
<answer><label>Historical</label>
  <para>&clisp; has been using the menorah for the logo since the project was
   first started in the late 1980-ies by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
   This <emphasis>probably</emphasis> reflects the authors' affection
   toward the Jewish people, Judaism or the State of Israel
   (neither of the two original authors is Jewish by birth).
   You may ask the original authors for details yourself.
   Both of them are very busy though, so do not expect a prompt reply.

<qandaentry id="faq-menorah-current"><question id="faq-menorah-current-q">
  <simpara>Shouldn't the logo be changed now due to the current
   political developments in the Middle East?</simpara></question>
<answer><para>The &clisp; developers, both the original creators and the
  current maintainers, do not subscribe to the mainstream view that
  blames the Jews for everything from high oil prices and Islamic
  extremism to El Ni&ntilde;o and global warming (or cooling, whatever
  the looming disaster du jour is).</para>
 <para>Moreover, today, when Jews are being pushed out of the American
  and European academic institutions with various obscene
  <ulink url="http://how_to_help_israel.tripod.com/Petition.htm">boycott</ulink>
  and <ulink url="http://www.divestmentwatch.com/">divestment</ulink>

  government of the <ulink url="http://www.chinasupport.net/">People's

<answer><para>Expressing their opinion is a perfectly natural thing for the
  authors, be it artistic preferences, political views or religious beliefs.
  The use of the menorah has its roots somewhere between these areas,
  and the authors are proud to display it.
  If you are unlucky enough to have lost the freedom to express your
  opinion, due to the constraints of a government, society, religion,
  or expectations of <quote>professional relationships</quote>,
  the Free World condoles with you.
  The authors of &clisp; are not operating under such constraints.
  If you are unhappy about their artistic preferences, political views or
  religious beliefs, you are free to ignore them.</para>

  Ren&eacute; Descartes and Isaak Newton combined mathematics and Christianity.

<qandaentry id="faq-licensing"><question id="faq-licensing-q"><simpara>When
   I deliver my application with &clisp;, does it have to be covered by
   the &gnu; &gpl;?</simpara></question>
<answer><para>Not necessarily.</para>

<para>&clisp; is <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
  Software</ulink>, covered by the &gnu; &gpl;, with special
 terms governing the distribution of applications that run in &clisp;.
 The precise terms can be found in the
 <filename role="clisp-cvs">COPYRIGHT</filename>
 file contained in the source and binary distributions of &clisp;.
 Here is an informal clarification of what these terms mean in practice.
 Please refer to the said <filename role="clisp-cvs">COPYRIGHT</filename>
 file when in doubt.</para>

<para>In many cases, &clisp; does not force an application to be covered
 by the &gnu; &gpl;. Nevertheless, we encourage you to release your software
 under an open source license. The benefits of such a license for
 your users are numerous, in particular they are free to modify the
 application when their needs/requirements change, and they are free to
 recompile the application when they upgrade their machine or operating
 system.</para>

<para>&clisp; <emphasis>extensions</emphasis>, i.e. programs which need
 to access non-portable &clisp; internal symbols (in the packages
 &sys-pac;, &clos-pac;, &ffi-pac;, etc), must be covered by &gnu; &gpl;
 as well.</para>

<para>Other programs running in &clisp; have to or need not to be placed
 under &gnu; &gpl;, depending on their distribution form:

<itemizedlist>
 <listitem><simpara>Programs distributed as Lisp source or &fasl-file;
   files can be distributed without restrictions coming from &clisp;.
 </simpara></listitem>
 <listitem><simpara>Programs distributed as &clisp; &mem-image;s can be
  distributed only if accompanied with the non-&clisp; &fasl-file; files
  which make up the &mem-image;, and a &make-file; (or clear textual
  instructions) for rebuilding the &mem-image;.</simpara></listitem>
 <listitem><simpara>If you need to distribute a modified &clisp;
  executable (for example, incorporating additional &module;s written
  in &c-lang;), you must distribute its full source under &gnu; &gpl;.
  If you are not satisfied with this, you can instead put the additional
  &module;s into a separate (non-&clisp;) program, with which your Lisp
  program will communicate via &socket-stream;s.</simpara></listitem>

<answer><para>This means that you are trying to read (<quote>invalid

 a non-&ascii; character from (or to) a character stream which has
 &ascii; &extfmt;. The default is described in
  <olink targetdoc="man" targetptr="opt-enc"/>.</para>

<para>This may also be caused by filesystem access.
 If you have files with names incompatible with your &path-enc;,
 filesystem access (e.g., &directory;) will &signal; this &error-t;.
 You will need to set &path-enc; or pass &opt-E; to &clisp;.
 Using a &enc1-1;, such as &iso-8859-1;,
 should help you avoid this error.</para>

<para>Note that this error may be signaled by the <quote>Print</quote>
 part of the &repl; and &not-e; by the function you call.
 E.g., if file <filename>"foo"</filename> contains non-&ascii; characters,
 you will see such an error when you type<programlisting language="lisp">
(&with-open-file; (s "foo" :direction :input &extfmt; &iso-8859-1;)
