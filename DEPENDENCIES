The following packages should be installed before GNU clisp is installed
(runtime dependencies that are also build dependencies):

* GNU libsigsegv
  + Highly recommended.
    Needed for catching stack overflows (otherwise a stack overflow may crash
    the process) and for generational garbage collection.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libsigsegv/
  + Download:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libsigsegv/
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libsigsegv-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* GNU libffcall
  + Highly recommended.
    Needed for the foreign function interface (FFI).
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libffcall/
  + Download:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libffcall/
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libffcall-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* GNU libiconv
  + Not needed on systems with glibc, on Mac OS X, and NetBSD.
    But recommended on all other systems.
    Needed for multibyte character set support (other than UTF-8,
    for which GNU libiconv is not needed).
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
  + Download:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libiconv/
  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* libintl, part of GNU gettext
  + Not needed on systems with glibc.
    But recommended on all other systems.
    Needed for localization of messages.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

    Needed for the interactive line-editing in the read-eval-print loop.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/readline/
  + Download:

  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libreadline-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* GNU ncurses (preferred)
  or libtermcap (discouraged) or a curses library (legacy).
  + Recommended.
    Needed for fancy input/output in terminal emulators.
  + Homepage:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/
  + Download:

  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
