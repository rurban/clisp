This is CLISP, a Common Lisp implementation.

CLISP is mostly ANSI CL compliant, including a CLOS implementation.

Mailing list
============

There are three mailing list for users of CLISP. You find subscription
information and archives on the homepage http://clisp.cons.org/.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Common Lisp CLISP

Common Lisp is
  * a convential programming language and an AI language
  * interactive
  * a Lisp for professional use

Common Lisp programs are
  * easy to test (interactive)
  * easy to maintain (depending on programming style)
  * portable (there is a standard for the language and the library functions)

Our Common Lisp CLISP
  * needs only 2 MB of memory
  * implements most of the ANSI standard, as well as some extensions
  * can call your preferred editor
  * is freely distributable

Common Lisp provides
  * clear syntax, carefully designed semantics
  * several data types: numbers, strings, arrays, lists, characters, symbols,
    structures, streams etc.
  * runtime typing: the programmer needn't bother about type declarations,
    but he gets notified on type violations.
  * many generic functions:
    88 arithmetic functions for all kinds of numbers (integers, ratios,
    floating point numbers, complex numbers),
    44 search/filter/sort functions for lists, arrays and strings
  * automatic memory management (garbage collection)
  * packaging of programs into modules
  * an object system, generic functions with powerful method combination
  * macros: every programmer can make his own language extensions

Our Common Lisp CLISP provides
  * an interpreter
  * a compiler which makes execution of programs 5 times faster
  * all data types with unlimited size (the size need never be declared,
    the size of lists and arrays may be changed dynamically)
  * integers of arbitrary length, unlimited floating point number precision
  * 594 library functions, 542 of them written in C

CLISP compares well with other ANSI CL implementations wrt performance
in most areas, such as CLOS, I/O, lists, integer arithmetics (CLISP's
bignum performance is better than that of some other CL implementations).
The worst performance CLISP exhibits in the area of floating point
arithmetics.  While showing nothing spectacularly bad and easily
outperforming Java, Perl, TCL and any Scheme interpreter, CLISP is slower
than another open-source CL implementation, CMU CL (http://www.cons.org/cmucl),
which outperforms C and FORTRAN.  If your code is heavily numeric, you
might prefer CMUCL, otherwise CLISP is a wise choice.
