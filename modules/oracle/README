This is the README for a low-level, but complete and functional module
for CLISP that allows one to use CLISP to program Oracle database
applications. The interface is built on top of the Oracle Call
Interface (OCI), which is Oracle's "C" language client library.  The
remainder of this README is organized as follows:

        (1) Background and design goals
        (2) Features of the module
        (3) Files in the distribution
        (4) System Requirements
        (5) Building the module
        (6) Using the module
        (7) How you can help
        (8) About the author
        (9) Acknowledgements

Each section follows.

        (1) BACKGROUND AND DESIGN GOALS
            ---------------------------

I decided to get back into Lisp after a 21-year hiatus since taking
the introductory Scheme course at MIT in 1981 (when Gerry Sussman and
Hal Abelson were still teaching it).  I was getting sick of Java and
perl.  Since I make my living hacking Oracle databases, I wanted
access to Oracle from the Lisp environment, which I chose CLISP due to
it's ease of use, stability, availability under the GPL, and it's
being the choice of some fairly respectable Lisp hackers.

The design goals of the library are, in order:

        - Simple and easy to use interface

        - Well tested and free of bugs

        - Well documented

        - Efficiency


        (2) FEATURES OF THE MODULE
            ----------------------

The module provides a rich set of features that can be used for Oracle
applications both simple and sophisticated.  The highlights are:

        - Source code avaiable under the GNU General Public License

        - Full access to most Oracle functionality, including all
          functions accessible via SQL

        - Complete error reporting, including pass-through of
          Oracle error messages and identification of the
          location of SQL parse errors

        - Support for transactions (WITH-TRANSACTION macro)

        - Auto-commit feature that commits database results to
          simplify applications that are not transaction intensive.

        - Automatic mapping of Oracle data types to and from
          Lisp data types (string, fixnum, bignum, NULL, etc.)

        - Convenient constructs for database inserts and updates

        - Constructs for looping over SELECT query results:
          a DO-ROWS macro, and a one-row lookahead buffer, useful
          for formatting reports at "breaks" in data streams.

        - Support for multiple, simultaneous connections to
          the same database or different databases

        - Connection caching, allowing re-used of previously
          established database connections, to minimize overhead


More details on these features can be got by doing
(DESCRIBE 'ORACLE:<function>) on a particular function.

        (3) FILES IN THE DISTRIBUTION
            -------------------------

The distribution consists of these files:

README                  This file
oracle.lisp             Lisp file defining the ORACLE package
orafns.c                "C" interface to Oracle
oiface.h                Wrapper functions and structure definitions
oiface.c                Wrapper functions
configure               auto-conf generated script build Makefile
Makefile.in             Makefile directives to build the module
link.sh                 Shell script to link module
examples.lisp           Example functions


        (4) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
            -------------------
Before you can use this module you need:

        - A working Oracle client environment, including the
          client OCI headers and libraries.  As a quick check,
          make sure you have $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/demo/oci.h

        - An Oracle server to connect to, and a userID and
          password on that server.

        - Oracle expertise, incl. knowledge of SQL and use
          of such tools as SQL*plus.

It is beyond the scope of this module for me to teach you how pto
install and use Oracle itself.  If you are not at least at a level of
proficiency where you can use SQL*Plus to connect to an Oracle
database, then you need to learn and/or install Oracle on your own
time (and that of your DBA :) before coming to me for help.


        (5) BUILDING THE MODULE
            -------------------

I've been advised by Sam Steingold, a CLISP maintainer, to build a
separate Lisp containing the Oracle module in a build other than the
default "src" subdirctory.  This is most easily accomplished by
installing the distribution in under the "modules" subdirectory of
your CLISP distribution, then running CLISP's "configure" script with
the --build option.  To combine this module with your CLISP source:

        cd /path/to/clisp/
        cp -p clisp-oracle-0.01.tar.gz .
        gunzip < clisp-oracle.tar.gz | tar xf

This module's tarball will expand into modules/oracle.  Then, in the
CLISP source directory, run "configure" with options to include the
Oracle module, and to build in a separate area.  The command I use is:

./configure                                     \
       --with-readline                          \
       --with-dynamic-ffi                       \
       --with-dynamic-modules                   \
       --with-export-syscalls                   \
       --with-module=wildcard                   \
       --with-module=regexp                     \
       --with-module=bindings/glibc             \
       --with-module=oracle                     \
       --build oralisp

If all goes well, this will build a complete Lisp in
        /path/to/clisp/oralisp/full
From that directory, you can run
         ./lisp.run -M lispinit.mem

You can test that you really have the Oracle-enabled Lisp by
evaluating (describe 'oracle:connect)

Test the module by editing "examples.lisp" to connect to your
particular Oracle server, then loading that file to do some simple
database operations.

        (6) USING THE MODULE
            ----------------

The module implements a Lisp package "ORACLE" which exports the
functions and macros below.  Each function and macro has a complete
documentation string that can be viewed with DESCRIBE.  E.g.:
(describe 'oracle:connect)

CONNECT                 Connect to Oracle server
DISCONNECT              Disconnect from Oracle server
RUN-SQL                 Execute SQL statement
DO-ROWS                 (Macro) Loop over SELECT result
FETCH                   Retrieve one row of SELECT result
FETCH-ALL               Retrieve all/some rows of SELECT result
PEEK                    Look-ahead to next row of SELECT result
COLUMNS                 Get name, type, size of SELECT columns
SQLCOL-*                Accessor functions for COLUMNS items
EOF                     Test if at end of SELECT result
INSERT-ROW              Add a row to a table
UPDATE-ROW              Update row(s) in a table
ROW-COUNT               Get count of rows affected by SQL statement
WITH-TRANSACTION        (Macro) Perform operations atomically
COMMIT                  Commit pending changes
ROLLBACK                Abandon pending changes
AUTO-COMMIT             Enable or disable "auto-commit" mode


        (7) HOW YOU CAN HELP
            ----------------

I would welcome those who can test this module on Unix platforms other
than Linux, and would like someday to port it to Windows as well.  Of
course, bug reports will be greatly appreciated.

Please understand that this is my first attempt to program in Lisp in
about twenty years, and that some of my code in "oracle.lisp" may be
pretty bad.  I would welcome constructive comments on that code,
perhaps as barter in return for whatever utility you may find in using
this library.

I am getting back into Lisp.


        (9) ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
            ----------------

I would like to thank the creators and maintainers of CLISP: Bruno
Haible and especially Sam Steingold for assistance on using CLISP's
very well documented "C" interface.  Also, I've received helpful
comments on the CLISP mailing lists from Joerg-Cyril Hoehle and Dan
Stanger.
