Installation on Unix:
---------------------

This file describes the standard installation procedure.
Please do read this entire file before starting
- or, if you are impatient, start with step 2 and then skip to step 12.
Special hints for some platforms can be found in file unix/PLATFORMS.
Despite this file's location, it is applicable to cygwin and mingw as well.

1. (Optional)
   Choose which C compiler to use for building CLISP.
   This is normally not necessary; if GNU C is available under the
   name "gcc", it will be used.

   For example, if you were wanting to use gcc with full warnings, then
   type, if you are using csh:

         setenv CC "gcc -Wall"

   or if you are using bash or ksh:

         export CC="gcc -Wall"

   or if you are using sh:

         CC="gcc -Wall"
         export CC

   On bi-arch systems, such as sparc, you *must* select word size explicitly,
   by setting CC to "gcc -m64".

2. (Recommended)
   Install a few libraries on which CLISP relies:
   * GNU libsigsegv
      + Highly recommended: needed for generational garbage collection
        and for stack overflow detection in interpreted Lisp code.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libsigsegv/>
      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigsegv/>
   * GNU libffcall
      + Highly recommended: needed for the foreign function interface.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libffcall/>
      <http://www.gnu.org/software/libffcall/>
   * GNU libiconv
      + Not needed on systems with glibc 2.2 or newer, or MacOS X 10.3 or
        newer, but recommended on all other systems for additional encodings.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/>
      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libiconv/>
   * GNU readline
      + Recommended: needed if you want terminal command line editing.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/>
      <http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html>
   * GNU gettext
      + Not needed on systems with glibc 2.2 or newer, but recommended on all
        other systems: needed if you want CLISP with native language support.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/>
      <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>

   When you install your libraries in a non-standard location, you will
   need to tell the location to the top-level configure, e.g.:

   ./configure --with-libreadline-prefix=/sw               \
               --with-libsigsegv-prefix=/usr/local         \
               --with-libiconv-prefix=/home/user/my/prefix \
               --with-module=libsvm --with-module=rawsock  \
               --cbc my-build-directory

   Note that on bi-arch systems, such as sparc, the 64-bit libraries are
   searched for in $prefix/lib64, not in $prefix/lib.
   This means that if you want to build a 64-bit CLISP on such a system,
   you will need to build, say, libsigsegv, like this:

   ./configure CC='gcc -m64' --prefix=<prefix> --libdir='${exec_prefix}/lib64'
   make && make check && make install

   and then build CLISP like this:

   ./configure CC='gcc -m64' --with-libsigsegv-prefix=<prefix> ...

3. Choose the name of a directory in which to build CLISP.
   (This allows you to build CLISP with different compilers on the same
   machine or for different architectures in the same filesystem, sharing
   the same source.)
   For example, depending on the chosen compiler, let's use build-with-gcc.
   Then execute

         ./configure build-with-gcc

   This will prepare a directory build-with-gcc/ and figure out many
   system and compiler dependent parameters needed by CLISP.

   (Note: Some `make's - for example the HP-UX make - have problems
   with symbolic links. You may avoid these by calling

         ./configure

   without argument. Then CLISP will be built in the src/ directory
   itself.)

   Note that the argument to configure can be an absolute pathname.
   For example, the following command will also work.

         ./configure /tmp/with-gcc-wall

   Note that you should not use a directory name with spaces in it.
   This is especially relevant to woe32-based systems, such as mingw and cygwin.
   Specifically, if your source distribution is in
     "C:\Documents and Settings\username\...\clisp\"
   then your best bet is "./configure /tmp/build-clisp",
   not "./configure build".

4. The previous step printed a recommendation how to continue.
   Follow the recommendation: go to this directory

         cd build-with-gcc

   For platform specific adjustment of the makefile, take a look at the
   PLATFORMS file.

5. If you wish to build CLISP with add-on modules, edit Makefile and
   change the line defining the MODULES variable.
   The list of modules included with the distribution is available via

         ./configure --help-modules

   This can be automated by adding --with-module= arguments to the ./configure
   invocation in step 2.

6. Edit the contents of config.lisp appropriately for your site,
   especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.

7. Type

         make

   to build CLISP.
   If you are an expert in building CLISP, you may alternatively do this
   in eleven easy to remember steps:
         make init                prepares all symbolic links and utilities
         make allc                makes all *.c files
         make lisp.run            makes the executable runtime
           (cygwin & mingw: use "make lisp.exe" instead)
         make interpreted.mem     a memory image with everything uncompiled
         make halfcompiled.mem    a memory image with compiler.fas and
                                   the rest uncompiled
         make lispinit.mem        makes all *.fas files and
                                   a memory image with everything compiled
         make manual              makes the documentation
         make modular             prepares for module building
         make boot                makes the boot linking set (just the core)
         make base                makes the base linking set
                                   (boot + regexp + syscalls + i18n + readline)
         make full                makes the full linking set (base + your
                                   MODULES variable in Makefile, see step 5)

   If something goes wrong, check and optionally modify the contents of
   the file config.h and retry this step. Yes, there are many warnings,
   we know. Most of them are harmless.

   If you need to switch to a different compiler, execute a
         make distclean
         cd ..
   and go back to step 1.

8. (Optionally)
   Three more tests for CLISP. Let the compiler (now compiled!) recompile
   itself:

         make check-recompile

   Check whether CLISP passes the XCL/CLISP test suite:

         make check-tests

   Check whether CLISP passes the Minejima/SACLA test suite
     (CVS tree only, not in the tar ball):

         make check-sacla-tests

   Check whether CLISP passes the Dietz/GCL test suite
     (CVS tree only, not in the tar ball):

         make check-ansi-tests

   Or run all available tests with one shot:

         make check

   If you build with some modules, you can test those of them that come
   with a test suite with:

         make mod-check

   Note that the modules may use external libraries, and test failures
   may indicate bugs in those libraries rather than in CLISP.
   See the specific test suite for detail.

9. Edit the `prefix' variable in the makefile (you could also have specified
   it as command line option --prefix=... to `configure' in step 3), then type

         make install

   If `prefix' is /usr/local, then this will install the CLISP binaries
   into /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib (creating a directory
   /usr/local/lib/clisp) and the manual page into /usr/local/man/man1.
   You may need superuser privileges for this step when installing into
   public directories.
   If you built with static modules (./configure --without-dynamic-modules)
   there will be two "linking sets" in /usr/local/lib/clisp/ - "base"
   and "full" (see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#modules>).
   You can chose which linking set to run by using "-K" option of clisp
   (see <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-link-set>)
   Note that some modules (i18n, regexp, syscalls and readline at this time)
   are included in the "base" linking set by default,
   see BASE_MODULES in build-dir/Makefile.
   Other modules can be REQUIREd at run time.

10. If you want other people to benefit from your work, you can make a binary
   distribution of CLISP for your platform which we will distribute.
   To do this, make sure you have executed step 7 above,
   adjust the definition of ROFF_MAN in the makefile,
   then type

         make distrib

   to create a binary distribution in a clisp-*.tar.gz file.
   Tell us about your success, and make that file available to us.

   If you want to distribute the binaries, recall that you have to accompany
   them with full source; see the files COPYING and GNU-GPL.

11. The last thing to do:

         cd ..

12. If you are lazy and have too few spare neurons to remember this long
    process, just use the shortcut, like I do:

         ./configure --with-module=rawsock --cbc build-dir

    this covers the build process through step 8 (except mod-check).


Additional Information for Maintainers of Binary Packages:
----------------------------------------------------------

1. CLISP build process respects the CFLAGS environment variable,
   and, when GCC is used and CFLAGS is unset, "-g -O2" is used, see
   <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/html_node/C-Compiler.html>.
   This means that if your distribution's policy is to minimize executables'
   size at the expense of debuggability you should configure CLISP like this:
        ./configure CFLAGS='' ...
   and let CLISP choose the optimization options.
   The often used alternative - to strip the executables before packaging -
   breaks DISASSEMBLE on functions written in C: (DISASSEMBLE #'CAR) prints
   the disassembly of the whole executable instead of just a few lines
   that constitute the function CAR.
   Note that makemake (the script run by configure and "make Makefile")
   will set the appropriate optimization level,
   so it does not matter if you set CFLAGS to "-O", "-O2" or just "".
   See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=199887>.

2. Despite whatever ldd may say to the contrary, CLISP is linked
   _statically_ against libsigsegv, so whenever you upgrade libsigsegv,
   you MUST recompile CLISP.
   See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=199525>.

3. Binary package creation: we recommend distributing module "clisp" containing
   just the base linking set and individual modules packaged separately.
   We recommend keeping the base linking set (i18n, regexp, syscalls, readline)
   intact in order to ensure a uniform experience to all CLISP users regardless
   of platform or distribution.
   Each additional module should be packaged separately (step [C] below):
   A. Build clisp using "./configure --prefix=/usr --cbc CFLAGS='' build-dir"
   B. Create the base "clisp" package:
      $ cd build-dir
      $ make install DESTDIR=foo
      $ cd foo; tar cfz clisp.tar.gz *; cd ..; rm -rf foo
   C. Create a module package "clisp-modname" where "modname" is the module
      name, e.g., "rawsock" or "clx/new-clx" or ...:
      # install the module dependencies, e.g., postgresql-dev or x11-dev or ...
      $ cd build-dir
      $ make install-modules MODULES=modname DESTDIR=foo
      $ cd foo; tar cfz clisp-modname.tar.gz *; cd ..; rm -rf foo
   D. Dependencies: each package "clisp-modname" depends on "clisp" and, maybe,
      on an external library to which it interfaces, e.g., postgresql or pcre.
      It does _not_ depend on any development tool (gcc, libffcall, pcre-dev).
      E.g., modules "clisp-rawsock" and "clisp-wildcard" depend only on "clisp".
   See also <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/modules.html#base-modules>
   and "./configure --help-modules".
