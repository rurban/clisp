# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

Oops!

Your 'rm' program seems unable to run without file operands specified
on the command line, even when the '-f' option is present.  This is contrary
to the behaviour of most rm programs out there, and not conforming with
the upcoming POSIX standard: <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>

Please tell bug-automake@gnu.org about your system, including the value
of your $PATH and any error possibly output before this message.  This
can help us improve future automake versions.

Aborting the configuration process, to ensure you take notice of the issue.

You can download and install GNU coreutils to get an 'rm' implementation
that behaves properly: <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>.

If you want to complete the configuration process using your problematic
'rm' anyway, export the environment variable ACCEPT_INFERIOR_RM_PROGRAM
to "yes", and re-run configure.

# gl_ABSOLUTE_HEADER(HEADER1 HEADER2 ...)

# Find the absolute name of a header file, testing first if the header exists.
# If the header were sys/inttypes.h, this macro would define
# ABSOLUTE_SYS_INTTYPES_H to the '""' quoted absolute name of sys/inttypes.h
# in config.h
# (e.g. '#define ABSOLUTE_SYS_INTTYPES_H "///usr/include/sys/inttypes.h"').
# The three "///" are to pacify Sun C 5.8, which otherwise would say
# "warning: #include of /usr/include/... may be non-portable".
# Use '""', not '<>', so that the /// cannot be confused with a C99 comment.
# Note: This macro assumes that the header file is not empty after
# preprocessing, i.e. it does not only define preprocessor macros but also
# provides some type/enum definitions or function/variable declarations.

# the fix is
#   1) to ensure that AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS is never directly invoked

[/* Please see the Gnulib manual for how to use these macros.

   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.

dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.

dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
dnl    the value '$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
dnl
dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
dnl    and used.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
dnl    Catalog format: none
dnl    Catalog extension: none
dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
dnl maintainers.

dnl This file is free software; the Free Software Foundation
dnl gives unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it,
dnl with or without modifications, as long as this notice is preserved.

dnl From Bruno Haible and Sam Steingold.

dnl Sets the HOST_CPU variable to the canonical name of the CPU.
dnl Sets the HOST_CPU_C_ABI variable to the canonical name of the CPU with its
dnl C language ABI (application binary interface).
dnl Also defines __${HOST_CPU}__ and __${HOST_CPU_C_ABI}__ as C macros in
dnl config.h.
dnl
dnl This canonical name can be used to select a particular assembly language
dnl source file that will interoperate with C code on the given host.
dnl
dnl For example:
dnl * 'i386' and 'sparc' are different canonical names, because code for i386
dnl   will not run on SPARC CPUs and vice versa. They have different
dnl   instruction sets.
dnl * 'sparc' and 'sparc64' are different canonical names, because code for
dnl   'sparc' and code for 'sparc64' cannot be linked together: 'sparc' code
dnl   contains 32-bit instructions, whereas 'sparc64' code contains 64-bit
dnl   instructions. A process on a SPARC CPU can be in 32-bit mode or in 64-bit
dnl   mode, but not both.
dnl * 'mips' and 'mipsn32' are different canonical names, because they use
dnl   different argument passing and return conventions for C functions, and
dnl   although the instruction set of 'mips' is a large subset of the
dnl   instruction set of 'mipsn32'.
dnl * 'mipsn32' and 'mips64' are different canonical names, because they use
dnl   different sizes for the C types like 'int' and 'void *', and although
dnl   the instruction sets of 'mipsn32' and 'mips64' are the same.
dnl * The same canonical name is used for different endiannesses. You can
dnl   determine the endianness through preprocessor symbols:
dnl   - 'arm': test __ARMEL__.
dnl   - 'mips', 'mipsn32', 'mips64': test _MIPSEB vs. _MIPSEL.
dnl   - 'powerpc64': test _BIG_ENDIAN vs. _LITTLE_ENDIAN.
dnl * The same name 'i386' is used for CPUs of type i386, i486, i586
dnl   (Pentium), AMD K7, Pentium II, Pentium IV, etc., because
dnl   - Instructions that do not exist on all of these CPUs (cmpxchg,
dnl     MMX, SSE, SSE2, 3DNow! etc.) are not frequently used. If your
dnl     assembly language source files use such instructions, you will
dnl     need to make the distinction.
dnl   - Speed of execution of the common instruction set is reasonable across
dnl     the entire family of CPUs. If you have assembly language source files
dnl     that are optimized for particular CPU types (like GNU gmp has), you
dnl     will need to make the distinction.

dnl This file is free software; the Free Software Foundation
dnl gives unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it,

dnl From Paul Eggert and Derek Price.

dnl Sets INCLUDE_NEXT and PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER.
dnl
dnl INCLUDE_NEXT expands to 'include_next' if the compiler supports it, or to
dnl 'include' otherwise.
dnl
dnl INCLUDE_NEXT_AS_FIRST_DIRECTIVE expands to 'include_next' if the compiler
dnl supports it in the special case that it is the first include directive in
dnl the given file, or to 'include' otherwise.
dnl
dnl PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER can be used in files that contain #include_next,
dnl so as to avoid GCC warnings when the gcc option -pedantic is used.
dnl '#pragma GCC system_header' has the same effect as if the file was found
dnl through the include search path specified with '-isystem' options (as
dnl opposed to the search path specified with '-I' options). Namely, gcc
dnl does not warn about some things, and on some systems (Solaris and Interix)
dnl __STDC__ evaluates to 0 instead of to 1. The latter is an undesired side
dnl effect; we are therefore careful to use 'defined __STDC__' or '1' instead
dnl of plain '__STDC__'.
dnl
dnl PRAGMA_COLUMNS can be used in files that override system header files, so
dnl as to avoid compilation errors on HP NonStop systems when the gnulib file
dnl is included by a system header file that does a "#pragma COLUMNS 80" (which
dnl has the effect of truncating the lines of that file and all files that it
dnl includes to 80 columns) and the gnulib file has lines longer than 80
dnl columns.

# Also, if #include_next works as first preprocessing directive in a file,
# define NEXT_AS_FIRST_DIRECTIVE_FOO_H to be '<foo.h>'; otherwise define it to
# be
# '"///usr/include/foo.h"', or whatever other absolute file name is suitable.
# That way, a header file with the following line:
#       #@INCLUDE_NEXT@ @NEXT_FOO_H@
# or

# even if the compiler does not support include_next.
# The three "///" are to pacify Sun C 5.8, which otherwise would say
# "warning: #include of /usr/include/... may be non-portable".
# Use '""', not '<>', so that the /// cannot be confused with a C99 comment.
# Note: This macro assumes that the header file is not empty after
# preprocessing, i.e. it does not only define preprocessor macros but also

dnl From Bruno Haible.
dnl Inspired by
dnl https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/open_posix_testsuite/conformance/interfaces/pthread_rwlock_rdlock/2-2.c
dnl by Intel Corporation.

dnl Test whether in a situation where
dnl   - an rwlock is taken by a reader and has a writer waiting,
dnl   - an additional reader requests the lock,
dnl   - the waiting writer and the requesting reader threads have the same
dnl     priority,
dnl the requesting reader thread gets blocked, so that at some point the
dnl waiting writer can acquire the lock.
dnl Without such a guarantee, when there a N readers and each of the readers
dnl spends more than 1/Nth of the time with the lock held, there is a high
dnl probability that the waiting writer will not get the lock in a given finite
dnl time, a phenomenon called "writer starvation".
dnl Without such a guarantee, applications have a hard time avoiding writer
dnl starvation.
dnl
dnl POSIX:2008 makes this requirement only for implementations that support TPS
dnl (Thread Priority Scheduling) and only for the scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO
dnl and SCHED_RR, see
dnl http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html
dnl but test verifies the guarantee regardless of TPS and regardless of
dnl scheduling policy.

dnl gl_THREADLIB
dnl ------------
dnl Tests for a multithreading library to be used.
dnl If the configure.ac contains a definition of the gl_THREADLIB_DEFAULT_NO
dnl (it must be placed before the invocation of gl_THREADLIB_EARLY!), then the
dnl default is 'no', otherwise it is system dependent. In both cases, the user
dnl can change the choice through the options --enable-threads=choice or
dnl --disable-threads.
dnl Defines at most one of the macros USE_POSIX_THREADS, USE_SOLARIS_THREADS,
dnl USE_PTH_THREADS, USE_WINDOWS_THREADS
dnl Sets the variables LIBTHREAD and LTLIBTHREAD to the linker options for use
dnl in a Makefile (LIBTHREAD for use without libtool, LTLIBTHREAD for use with
dnl libtool).
dnl Sets the variables LIBMULTITHREAD and LTLIBMULTITHREAD similarly, for
dnl programs that really need multithread functionality. The difference
dnl between LIBTHREAD and LIBMULTITHREAD is that on platforms supporting weak
dnl symbols, typically LIBTHREAD is empty whereas LIBMULTITHREAD is not.
dnl Adds to CPPFLAGS the flag -D_REENTRANT or -D_THREAD_SAFE if needed for
dnl multithread-safe programs.

# gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE(INCLUDES, NAMES)
# ---------------------------------------
# For each whitespace-separated element in the list of NAMES, define
# HAVE_RAW_DECL_name if the function has a declaration among INCLUDES
# even after being undefined as a macro.
#
# See warn-on-use.h for some hints on how to poison function names, as
# well as ideas on poisoning global variables and macros.  NAMES may
# include global variables, but remember that only functions work with
# _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  Typically, INCLUDES only needs to list a single
# header, but if the replacement header pulls in other headers because
# some systems declare functions in the wrong header, then INCLUDES
# should do likewise.
#
# It is generally safe to assume declarations for functions declared
# in the intersection of C89 and C11 (such as printf) without
# needing gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE.

# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
#
# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN),
# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
#
# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
#
# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6.
#
# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
