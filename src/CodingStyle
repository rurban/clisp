                        CLISP sources coding style
                        ==========================

Lisp developers are individualists, and every individualist tends to have
his own preferred coding style. Nevertheless, on projects like CLISP where
several people come together to hack the same source, it is necessary to
adhere to a common coding style, so that other developers enjoy reading
your code.

A common coding style is a compromise for all participants, and it is also
an exercise in tolerance. When I contribute code to Linux, I adhere to the
Linux coding style (/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle - very
recommended reading). When I contribute to GCC, I follow the GNU coding style
("info standards"), although I get nauseas when I look at the result.
When I write for XFree86, I follow their style; it's a somewhat neutral one.

As a general rule, don't reformat entire files other people have written;
that will make the other developers spit. Instead, adhere to the particular
file's predominant style (even if it is not the same as the general style
used in the project).

A lot of good advice about naming conventions and placement and contents of
comments can be found in other places; therefore I skip these issues here.
I'll mention only one rule about

                          Special variables
                          -----------------

All variables which are subject to 'defvar', 'defparameter' or 'declare
special' (even if only locally in a function) must be surrounded by asterisks.
I had once in a program a special variable called 'line', and it caused me
an hour of debugging time at least. I will not make this mistake again...

                              Tabs
                              ----

In CLISP source, except for Makefiles and ChangeLog files, we don't use tabs.
This is because they have no functional advantage, and make "diff" output
harder to read and understand. And also, because some editors on Windows have
a default tab width of 4, whereas on Unix, the common consensus is a tab width
of 8. If you are using Emacs and want to contribute to CLISP, the best way to
ensure that you don't send us tabs by mistake is to add the following lines
to your $HOME/.emacs file:

    ; Tabs are anachronistic.
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

                             Lisp indentation
                             ----------------

We try to keep things in 79 columns, because that's the default width of
Emacs windows.

We use an indentation of two spaces - regardless whether it's for body
forms of 'let' and 'progn', or for the arguments of functions or macros.

Parentheses are set in one of two styles. The more mainstream one is to
add closing parens at the end of the last line, like this:

(defun get-funname-symbol (funname)
  (if (atom funname)
    funname
    (get-setf-symbol (second funname))))

Then there is also the "Bruno style". Its characteristic is that closing
parentheses are located either on the same line as the corresponding opening
paren, or on extra lines containing only closing parentheses:

(defun get-funname-symbol (funname)
  (if (atom funname)
    funname
    (get-setf-symbol (second funname))
) )

This one is less mainstream, but it permits me to "see" the structure of a
large expression more easily. And it also requires fewer editor operations
in order to swap the two legs of the 'if' expression.

'multiple-value-bind' expressions are indented specially: If the values-
producing form doesn't fit on the same line, it is indented by 4 spaces,
in order to distinguish it from the following progn-like sequence of forms:

    (multiple-value-bind (vr vl sv se ge)
        (get-setf-expansion (first arglist) env)
      (setq bindlist (nreconc (mapcar #'list vr vl) bindlist))
      (setf (cadr tail) (list 'MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND lv ge nil))
      ...

In 'if' expressions both legs are indented by the same amount: two spaces.

If you are using Emacs and want to use its indenter, you have to teach it
about Common Lisp. By default, in Lisp mode, it indents for Emacs Lisp.
(This is also the reason for its 4-then-2 'if' expression indentation: in
Emacs Lisp, the second subform of 'if' is the 'true' case, whereas the third
and subsequent subforms together make up the 'else' case. Common Lisp does
not have this irregularity.)

To get Common Lisp indentation, add the following to your $HOME/.emacs file:

         ;; Common Lisp indentation.
         (load-library "cl-indent")
         (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
             (setq lisp-indent-function 'common-lisp-indent-function)
         ) )
         ;; Additional definitions by Pierpaolo Bernardi.
         (defun cl-indent (sym indent)
           (put sym 'common-lisp-indent-function
             (if (symbolp indent)
               (get indent 'common-lisp-indent-function)
               indent
         ) ) )
         (cl-indent 'if '1)
         (cl-indent 'defclass '((&whole 4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1))
                                &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)))
         (cl-indent 'defgeneric 'defun)
         (cl-indent 'defmethod '(4 4 (&whole 4 &rest 1) &body))
         (cl-indent 'generic-flet 'flet)
         (cl-indent 'generic-labels 'labels)
         (cl-indent 'symbol-macrolet 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'with-accessors 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'with-added-methods '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'with-slots 'multiple-value-bind)
         (cl-indent 'handler-bind '((&whole 4 &rest 1) 2 &body))
         (cl-indent 'handler-case '((1 4) (&whole 2 ((0 1) (1 3) (2 &body)))))
         (cl-indent 'define-condition '((1 6)
                                        (2 6 ((&whole 1)))
                                        (3 4 ((&whole 1)))
                                        (4 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'restart-bind '(((&whole 2 (0 1) (&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'restart-case '((1 4) (&whole 2 ((0 1) (&whole 1)))))
         (cl-indent 'with-condition-restarts '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))
         (cl-indent 'with-simple-restart '((1 4 ((&whole 1))) (2 &body)))

More special rules for macros may be needed; watch out responsibly yourself.

                               C style
                               -------

Most of the C code of CLISP is stored in files with extension '.d'. It _is_
C code, but the file will be preprocessed a bit.

A comment until end of line is introduced by '# '. Other '#' signs, not
followed by a space, have the usual C meaning.

Preprocessor commands can start at any column, not necessarily at the first
column of a line.

These 'var' symbols that you encounter in every function introduce variable
declarations. We use one variable per declaration; the C syntax rules make
declarations of multiple variables on the same line hard to read and hard
to edit. 'var' is a preprocessor symbol which expands to nothing. Writing
'var' not only makes it human reader to understand the code; it also allows
you to mix declarations and statements freely, without the need for
additional braces.

We have a few macros defined in lispbibl.d: 'elif' means 'else if',
'until' means 'while not'. 'loop' introduces a loop which can be exited
only via 'break'; it's equivalent to 'for(;;)'.

                              C indentation
                              -------------

The general style is similar to K&R style or Linux kernel style, with a
tab width of 2 spaces. A typical 'if' or 'while' statement looks like this:

      while (consp(keylistr)) {
        if (eq(item,Car(keylistr)))
          goto found;
        keylistr = Cdr(keylistr);
      }

When statements have to span lines, split them before the operator; this
is what the GNU standards recommend:

            if (mconsp(Car(alist)) && simple_string_p(Car(Car(alist)))
                && string_equal(line,Car(Car(alist)))
               ) {

You can't use Emacs to indent .d files, because the Emacs indenter interprets
'# ' as the start of a preprocessor command, with disastrous effects. Use
Emacs 'text-mode' instead.

                            German comments
                            ---------------

When CLISP was written, it was not anticipated to have wide distribution.
We are sorry about the German comments. If you are a native German speaker,
you are welcome to faithfully translate them to English. If not, then
please leave them alone and wait for someone to translate them to English.
